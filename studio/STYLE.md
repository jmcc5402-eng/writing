# Style

Shared conventions. A book may override any of these in its own bible — if it
does, the book wins, and the override should be written down there.

## Files

- Manuscripts, bibles, outlines, and notes are Markdown.
- Wrap at 80 columns.
- One chapter per file. Name them so they sort: `ch01-the-return.md`.
- A book's bible is `STORY_BIBLE.md` at the root of the book's directory.

## Drafting

- Break lines at clause and sentence boundaries rather than filling to the
  margin. A reworded sentence should produce a one-line diff.
- Mark unresolved choices inline with `[TK ...]` — placeholder, needs deciding.
  `[TK surname]`, `[TK does she already know?]`. They are meant to be greppable:
  `grep -rn '\[TK' books/` should return the full list of open questions.
- Don't delete a scene to revise it. Move it aside, then cut when the
  replacement is working.

## Prose defaults

- American spelling, serial comma.
- Em dashes unspaced — like this.
- Scene breaks are a centered `***` on its own line.
- Numbers under one hundred spelled out in narration; numerals in dialogue only
  where a character would say them that way.

## Revision passes

Run them separately. Combining them is how notes get lost:

1. **Structure** — does the scene earn its place, and does it turn?
2. **Character** — is the want, the obstacle, and the cost visible?
3. **Line** — rhythm, repetition, filter words, weak verbs.
4. **Continuity** — names, ages, timeline, geography, established facts.
